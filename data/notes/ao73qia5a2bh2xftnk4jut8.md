## Model 02

- for emission measurements in the range 20 Hz to 100 (200) MHz

- Model 02 with its flat frequency response above 1 MHz and output ­ impedance of 50 W is ideal for emission measurements as well as for
measuring the shielding effectiveness

## Model 03

- for emission and susceptibility measurements in the range 20 Hz to 100 (200) MHz

- Due to its small transducer factor in the range from 1 MHz to 200 MHz, model 03 is particularly suitable for emission measurements with stringent requirements placed on sensitivity (e.g. VG 95 373 limit class 1) and, due to its high load capacity, also recommended for EMS measurements
(bulk current injection tests)
